    <h1 class="post_title"><a href="index.html">Internal Combustion Engine</a></h1>
    <div class="padding_wrapper"><p>The invention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine">internal combustion engine</a> in the 19<sup>th</sup> century has revolutionized transportation over land, water, and air. Despite their omnipresence in modern day, the operation of an engine may be cryptic. Over the course of this article I&rsquo;d like to explain the functionality of all the basic engine parts shown in the demonstration below. You can drag it around to see it from other angles:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_hero"></div>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to talk about a mechanical device without visualizing its motion, so many demonstrations in this blog post are animated. By default all animations are <span id="global_animate_on">enabled, but if you find them distracting, or if you want to save power, you can <a href="index.html#" class="link_button" onclick="global_animate(false);return false;">globally pause</a> them.</span><span id="global_animate_off" class="hidden">disabled, but if you&rsquo;d prefer to have things moving as you read you can <a href="index.html#"  class="link_button" onclick="global_animate(true);return false;">globally unpause</a> them.</span></p>
<p>An engine like this may seem complicated, but we will build it up from first principles. In fact, we&rsquo;ll start with a significantly simpler way of generating a rotational motion.</p>
<h1 id="crank">Crank<a href="index.html#crank" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><img src="../images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"/></a> </h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a simple crank. It consists of a <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>handle</strong></span>, a <span class="ice_red"><strong>crank arm</strong></span>, and a <span class="ice_blue"><strong>shaft</strong></span>. When a <span class="ice_green"><strong>force</strong></span> is applied to the handle the shaft rotates which we can observe by looking at the attached disk:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_simple_crank"></div>
<p>The <span class="ice_green"><strong>force</strong></span> applied at a distance from the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>shaft</strong></span> generates <a href="../gears/index.html#torque">torque</a>. The harder we push on the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>handle</strong></span>, the bigger the torque on the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>shaft</strong></span>. This cranking mechanism is precisely what converts linear force into torque in a manual coffee grinder or a bicycle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to power something using our own muscles, but the entire point of building an engine is to avoid manual labor and have the device exert the effort instead. To do that we need to find a reliable source of a strong force that is easy to direct. Thankfully, such device was invented hundreds of years ago – a <em>cannon</em> does exactly what we need. In the demonstration below you can observe how a <strong>cannon ball</strong> is fired from a <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>cannon</strong></span>. The diagonal lines indicate a <em>cross section</em> view – it lets us see what&rsquo;s going on inside an otherwise obscured region:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_cannon"></div>
<div id="ice_cannon_sl0"></div>
<p>As the gun powder is set on fire it quickly produces a huge amount of gases, which push the cannon ball down the barrel. Since the ball snugly fits inside it can only go in one direction. While reliable and easy to direct, a cannon ball won&rsquo;t be very effective at pushing the crank:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_simple_crank_cannon"></div>
<div id="ice_simple_crank_cannon_sl0"></div>
<p>We&rsquo;ve only been able to do a partial turn of the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>shaft</strong></span> and the cannon ball is long gone. However, with a few modifications we can harness the pushing power of the explosion in a significantly better way.</p>
<p>Firstly, we&rsquo;ll replace a cannonball with a <span class="ice_red"><strong>piston</strong></span> that has a cylindrical shape and a hole drilled in it. We&rsquo;ll then use a <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>pin</strong></span> to attach to it a <span class="ice_green"><strong>rod</strong></span> that can swing freely on a <span class="ice_blue"><strong>crankshaft</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_simple_assembly"></div>
<div id="ice_simple_assembly_sl0"></div>
<p>As the name implies, the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>crankshaft</strong></span> consists of both the rotating shaft and the crank on which a force is applied. By putting this assembly inside a simplified cannon shell, a <span class="ice_gray"><strong>cylinder</strong></span>, we&rsquo;ve managed to solve the problem of the escaping cannon ball, as the <span class="ice_red"><strong>piston</strong></span> is limited in its downward movement and will return up as the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>crankshaft</strong></span> keeps turning:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_simple_stroke"></div>
<p>Notice that the <span class="ice_red"><strong>piston</strong></span> has now a minimum and a maximum position it can reach within the <span class="ice_gray"><strong>cylinder</strong></span>. A single movement over that length in either up or down direction is called a <em>stroke</em>. If we now trigger the explosion, the combustion gases will push the <span class="ice_red"><strong>piston</strong></span> down, which turns the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>crankshaft</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_simple_stroke_down"></div>
<div id="ice_simple_stroke_down_sl0"></div>
<p>It&rsquo;s still not a very exciting machine as it only does useful turning work once. To make it more practical we need to keep repeating the cycle of explosions – we have to add in new fuel, trigger a combustion process, and remove the exhaust gases, over and over again.</p>
<p>Solid fuels like black powder are not very practical for an automated machine. It&rsquo;s much easier to deal with fuels in fluid forms – their intake can be controlled by various valves. We&rsquo;ll modify the cylinder we&rsquo;ve built so far by adding new openings at the top of the combustion chamber:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_simple_cylinder"></div>
<p>It may be hard to see how the various openings are laid out, so let&rsquo;s take a look at the cross section view:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_simple_cylinder_cross"></div>
<p>Through the first large curved opening we&rsquo;ll provide a mixture of gasoline and air and through the second one we&rsquo;ll remove the exhaust gases. Those two openings will be guarded by the <span class="ice_green"><strong>intake valve</strong></span> and the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>exhaust valve</strong></span>. Finally, to light the mixture, we&rsquo;ll use an electric spark generated by an exposed ends of a <span class="ice_dark_gray"><strong>wire</strong></span>. Let&rsquo;s see how all the pieces fit together:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_cylinder_valve_setup"></div>
<div id="ice_cylinder_valve_setup_sl0"></div>
<p>We&rsquo;re now ready to use this machine to do useful work. At first we&rsquo;ll open the <span class="ice_green"><strong>intake valve</strong></span> while the <span class="ice_red"><strong>piston</strong></span> is moving down letting the air with fuel come in which I&rsquo;ve symbolized using the yellow color. This is the <em>intake</em> stroke:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_cylinder_valve_stroke0"></div>
<div id="ice_cylinder_valve_stroke0_sl0"></div>
<p>Once the <span class="ice_red"><strong>piston</strong></span> reaches its lowest position the <span class="ice_green"><strong>intake valve</strong></span> closes, and the <span class="ice_red"><strong>piston</strong></span> starts to move back which compresses the mixture of air and fuel which increases the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_efficiency">thermal efficiency</a> of the combustion. This is the <em>compression</em> stroke:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_cylinder_valve_stroke1"></div>
<div id="ice_cylinder_valve_stroke1_sl0"></div>
<p>Voltage runs through the open ends of the wire, generating a spark which ignites the air-fuel mixture. The expanding gases created by the combustion push the <span class="ice_red"><strong>piston</strong></span> down, creating torque on the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>crankshaft</strong></span>. This is the <em>power</em> stroke:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_cylinder_valve_stroke2"></div>
<div id="ice_cylinder_valve_stroke2_sl0"></div>
<p>Note that the flame propagation inside a cylinder is <a href="https://youtu.be/xflY5uS-nnw?t=333">quite complex</a>, and what you see here is a simplified visualization. The <span class="ice_gray"><strong>cylinder</strong></span> is now filled with the exhaust gases which we can vent out through another hole by opening the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>exhaust valve</strong></span>. This is the <em>exhaust</em> stroke:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_cylinder_valve_stroke3"></div>
<div id="ice_cylinder_valve_stroke3_sl0"></div>
<p>We&rsquo;re now back to where we started and the cycle is complete. Let&rsquo;s look at those four steps together:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_cylinder_valve_strokes"></div>
<p>Since the <span class="ice_red"><strong>piston</strong></span> moves down twice and up twice, it does a total of <em>four</em> strokes and the engine we&rsquo;ve built is known as a <em>four-stroke engine</em>. Notice that it takes <em>two</em> revolutions of the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>crankshaft</strong></span> for the <span class="ice_red"><strong>piston</strong></span> to do <em>one</em> full cycle of the work as it goes through the four phases: intake, compression, power, and exhaust.</p>
<p>While functional, the engine we’ve built is more of a toy example that doesn&rsquo;t show a lot of the engineering ingenuity behind many components of real internal combustion engines. Let&rsquo;s build on the principles we&rsquo;ve devised so far by constructing a more realistic machine – an engine that one could find in a car.</p>
<h1 id="engine-block">Engine Block<a href="index.html#engine-block" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><img src="../images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"/></a> </h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the biggest and heaviest part of an engine – the <em>engine block</em>. It forms the main body and mounting structure for other parts:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_block"></div>
<p>Notice that this block contains <em>four</em> large <a href="index.html#" class="link_button" onclick="ice_cylinders();return false;">cylindrical openings</a> that define the four cylinders. Recall that a piston exerts a pushing force on the crankshaft only during the power stroke, so only for about a quarter of time. This uneven action creates a lot of vibration. While it&rsquo;s often acceptable for smaller engines e.g. in a lawn mower, a typical car engine has more than one cylinder to ensure a more even delivery of power. I&rsquo;ll discuss these concepts in more depth near the end of the article.</p>
<p>Since the four cylinders are inline, the engine we&rsquo;ll build is known as an inline four cylinder engine. Other engines may use different arrangements of cylinders, usually in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_engine">flat</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_engine">V-shape</a> configuration.</p>
<p>The sides of the block are reinforced by various ribs to improve the rigidity of the structure – the body has to withhold the power of the explosions inside the cylinders. You may also have realized that the top part of the block is perfectly flat – we&rsquo;ll soon attach another component there. If you look at the cross section of the block you&rsquo;ll notice that the areas around cylinders are empty:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_block_cut"></div>
<p>Those passages are there for the coolant to flow around the cylinders and take the heat of the combustion away. While I&rsquo;m not going to dive into details of engine cooling, it&rsquo;s worth noting that engines should run at a specific operating temperature and the coolant pump, thermostats, and radiators make sure that the engine isn&rsquo;t running too cold or too hot.</p>
<h1 id="crankshaft">Crankshaft<a href="index.html#crankshaft" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><img src="../images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"/></a> </h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the first big part we&rsquo;ll mount onto the engine – the crankshaft:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_crankshaft"></div>
<p>Notice that the crankshaft has five main cylindrical parts that define its axis of rotation, they&rsquo;re called the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>main journals</strong></span>. There are also four <span class="ice_red"><strong>rod journals</strong></span> that are positioned off-axis. All the journals are connected via  <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>webs</strong></span>. Note that while the sections have different colors here, the entire crankshaft is made from a single piece of metal.</p>
<p>You may wonder why the two inner <span class="ice_red"><strong>rod journals</strong></span> are offset differently than the two outer ones, so let&rsquo;s pop the <span class="ice_gray"><strong>piston assemblies</strong></span> on and see how they&rsquo;ll move on the crankshaft:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_crankshaft_pistons"></div>
<p>Since the <span class="ice_red"><strong>rod journals</strong></span> are at different locations each of the four pistons can run at a different phase of the four stroke cycle. Notice that the distance between the center of the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>main journals</strong></span> and the <span class="ice_red"><strong>rod journals</strong></span>  defines how far up and down the piston goes in the cylinder.</p>
<p>A real piston and its connecting rod have some mass so they end up creating a weight imbalance on a rotating crankshaft. To counteract that mass, the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>webs</strong></span> have elongated shape to form a counterweight that helps to even out the inertial forces on the shaft.</p>
<p>One could assume the installation of the crankshaft in the <span class="ice_gray"><strong>engine block</strong></span> is as simple as putting it directly in a designated spot at the bottom:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_block2"></div>
<p>Unfortunately, that wouldn&rsquo;t really work. During engine operation the pistons exert a lot of force on the crankshaft and the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>main journals</strong></span> would just rub against the housing creating a lot of friction that would wear the parts down. To fix that we need to firstly put in some <span class="ice_red"><strong>bearings</strong></span> that will help to make the rotation of the crankshaft smooth:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_main_bearings"></div>
<p>These strips of metal don&rsquo;t look like much, but <span class="ice_red"><strong>bearings</strong></span> are usually made from a softer material which causes them to wear first which prevents degradation of the crankshaft itself in case any contact occurs. Most of the time, however, the crankshaft doesn&rsquo;t actually touch the <span class="ice_red"><strong>bearings</strong></span> at all. Notice the small hole in the <span class="ice_red"><strong>bearing</strong></span> that matches the corresponding hole inside the <span class="ice_gray"><strong>engine block</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_main_bearings_mount"></div>
<div id="ice_main_bearings_mount_sl0"></div>
<p>Through that hole the engine pumps oil under pressure. The crankshaft&rsquo;s diameter is slightly smaller than the <span class="ice_red"><strong>bearings'</strong></span> inner diameter so oil fills the tiny gap between the two surfaces. Presence of oil is critical here as it creates conditions for <em>hydrodynamic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubrication">lubrication</a></em>. Oil sticks to the <span class="ice_red"><strong>bearings</strong></span> and the <span class="ice_gray"><strong>crankshaft</strong></span>, but since the <span class="ice_gray"><strong>crankshaft</strong></span> rotates it creates a variation in velocity of <span class="ice_oil"><strong>oil</strong></span> between the two surfaces. In the demonstration below the small arrows symbolize the local velocity of the liquid:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_hydrodynamic"></div>
<p>The difference of diameters causes a wedge-like shape to develop which then creates an area of increased pressure that lifts the <span class="ice_gray"><strong>crankshaft journal</strong></span> away from the <span class="ice_red"><strong>bearings</strong></span>. Note that the size of the gap in the demonstration is not to scale, but in real running engines the rotating <span class="ice_gray"><strong>crankshaft</strong></span> should float completely on a very thin surface of oil.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that one half of the bearings also contains a small gutter which creates a small pool of oil under pressure. Moreover, the crankshaft has small holes in it:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_crankshaft2"></div>
<p>Those passages are actually connected inside and the oil from the pool in the bearing travels through the little passages in the crankshaft itself. This brilliant solution distributes the oil from the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>main journals</strong></span> to the <span class="ice_red"><strong>rod journals</strong></span>, which are constantly changing their position inside the engine. The demonstration below shows one of the many typical arrangements of these passages and the presence of <span class="ice_oil"><strong>oil</strong></span> in and on the crankshaft:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_crankshaft_oil"></div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s finally put the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>crankshaft</strong></span> in. We&rsquo;ll clamp it down using five <span class="ice_blue"><strong>end caps</strong></span> that have their corresponding <span class="ice_red"><strong>bearings</strong></span> put in and we&rsquo;ll <span class="ice_green"><strong>screw</strong></span> everything together:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_crank_assembly"></div>
<div id="ice_crank_assembly_sl0"></div>
<p>Those <span class="ice_green"><strong>screws</strong></span> have to be tightened to a precise torque – it has to be high enough so that <span class="ice_blue"><strong>end caps</strong></span> are able to keep the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>crankshaft</strong></span> in place despite the force of explosions pushing down on it through the piston rods, but the torque on the <span class="ice_green"><strong>screws</strong></span> can&rsquo;t be too high to avoid any deformation of the circular shape of the final opening in which the crankshaft lies.</p>
<h1 id="pistons">Pistons<a href="index.html#pistons" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><img src="../images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"/></a> </h1>
<p>The crankshaft itself is there to receive the force from the pistons, so let&rsquo;s look at at one up close:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_piston"></div>
<p>Firstly, notice all the empty spaces inside the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>piston</strong></span>. They&rsquo;re there to reduce the weight – a <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>piston</strong></span> should be as light as possible to minimize the inertial forces created by its reciprocating motion. In this piston the top part known as the <em>piston crown</em> has a dish-like cavity in it. Other pistons may be flat or have <a href="https://help.summitracing.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5017/~/piston-styles">more complicated shapes</a>.</p>
<p>Pistons have actually slightly smaller diameter than the cylinders, otherwise they could <em>seize</em> during movement resulting in a catastrophic engine failure. However, the piston still needs to seal the combustion chamber and prevent gases from leaking around the piston. This problem is solved by <span class="ice_red"><strong>piston rings</strong></span> that are placed in the grooves on top of the <span class="ice_gray"><strong>piston</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_piston_rings"></div>
<div id="ice_piston_rings_sl0"></div>
<p>On their own <span class="ice_red"><strong>piston rings</strong></span> have a fairly big gap, but when placed in the cylinder they&rsquo;re squeezed into a fitting shape. Note that the fitted ring still has a tiny gap:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_piston_ring_fit"></div>
<div id="ice_piston_ring_fit_sl0"></div>
<p>While the gap shrinks when a <span class="ice_red"><strong>ring</strong></span> gets warmer and expands, the gap should never completely close as the ring may break under pressure. The clearances in the sizing of the rings are very precise. Since the <span class="ice_red"><strong>ring</strong></span> is squeezed into a smaller shape, it wants to expand and that tension helps it form a tight seal with the walls of the cylinder. That tension is also reinforced by the pressurized gases getting into the piston grooves and pushing the rings further against the cylinder walls.</p>
<p>The pistons in our engine have three rings with the top two primarily helping to keep the pressure inside the combustion chamber. The third one serves a different role – it&rsquo;s an <em>oil control ring</em>. The walls of a cylinder under a piston are constantly sprayed with a supply of oil to ensure a smooth movement during strokes. On a downstroke the oil ring scrapes the excessive amount of oil which escapes through the openings in the ring and the groove of the piston:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_oil_ring"></div>
<p>Top of a piston faces the enormous heat of combustion. The rings are in contact with the piston <em>and</em> the cylinder walls so they heavily participate in heat dissipation. Moreover, since the top part of the piston is in closer contact with the hot gases, it reaches a higher temperature than the lower parts and therefore it expands more. To account for that the pistons are tapered on top so that when the different areas of a piston reach their operating temperatures the shape is more even.</p>
<p>The area of the piston below the rings is called a <em>skirt</em>. Parts of the skirt are, through a thin layer of oil, in contact with cylinder walls during stroke which stabilizes the piston. While they look perfectly round, piston skirts are actually <a href="https://www.enginelabs.com/engine-tech/the-shape-of-things-why-your-piston-skirts-arent-round/">slightly oval</a>.</p>
<p>A <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>piston</strong></span> is attached to its <span class="ice_blue"><strong>rod</strong></span>  via a <span class="ice_green"><strong>gudgeon pin</strong></span>. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve noticed that a <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>piston</strong></span> has tiny grooves near the end of the pin opening. We&rsquo;ll put <span class="ice_dark_gray"><strong>snap rings</strong></span>  inside them – they&rsquo;ll prevent the <span class="ice_green"><strong>pin</strong></span> from leaving the hole:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_piston_assembly"></div>
<div id="ice_piston_assembly_sl0"></div>
<p>Piston <span class="ice_blue"><strong>rods</strong></span> themselves are very strong as they have to withstand the force of the explosions pressing on the piston during combustion, while also resisting a stretching and pushing forces due to the inertia of the piston changing its direction of movement.</p>
<p>The <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>pistons</strong></span> with the connecting <span class="ice_blue"><strong>rods</strong></span> and <span class="ice_red"><strong>bearings</strong></span> can be slid down the cylinders and attached to the <span class="ice_green"><strong>crankshaft</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_crankshaft_pistons_assembly"></div>
<div id="ice_crankshaft_pistons_assembly_sl0"></div>
<p>Recall that the <span class="ice_red"><strong>rod bearings</strong></span> are lubricated by the oil coming in through crankshaft passages. Let&rsquo;s see how the entire thing rotates:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_crankshaft_pistons_block"></div>
<p>The movement of a <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>piston</strong></span> as the function of the <span class="ice_green"><strong>crankshaft</strong></span> angle deserves a closer look. In the demonstration below I marked the maximum, minimum, and a midpoint traveled distance of a <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>piston</strong></span> during its stroke. You can control the rotation of the <span class="ice_green"><strong>crankshaft</strong></span> with a slider:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_crankshaft_piston_limits"></div>
<div class="ice_green" id="ice_crankshaft_piston_limits_sl0"></div>
<p>Notice that when the crank arm has done a <a href="index.html#" class="link_button" onclick="crank_90();return false;">90° turn</a>, i.e. halfway through between top to bottom angle, the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>piston</strong></span>  has moved up by <em>less</em> than half of its total stroke distance. It&rsquo;s a simple geometrical consequence of the length of arms of the triangle formed by the crank arm, the connecting rod, and the vertical baseline.</p>
<p>The maximum piston&rsquo;s position is known as its <em>top dead center</em>, and its lowest position is known as <em>bottom dead center</em>. As the cylinders move up and down between those two extremes they sweep <span class="ice_red"><strong>cylindrical volumes</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_displacement"></div>
<p>The area of a cylinder&rsquo;s circular cross section <strong>A</strong> times the stroke length of a piston <strong>S</strong> define the displacement volume of that cylinder, and the displacement <strong>V</strong> of the entire engine is the sum of displacements of <em>all</em> of its <strong>n</strong> cylinders:</p>
<div class="equation">
V = n &middot; A &middot; S
</div>
<p>If a single cylinder&rsquo;s displacement is half a liter, then a four cylinder engine would be known as a 2.0-L engine. In the most basic setup, the bigger the engine displacement, the more air the engine can suck in, and the higher its peak power.</p>
<h1 id="closing-the-lid">Closing the Lid<a href="index.html#closing-the-lid" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><img src="../images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"/></a> </h1>
<p>With the parts we&rsquo;ve assembled so far we&rsquo;re getting close to completing the combustion chamber. We&rsquo;ve created the walls with the engine block and the movable bottom with the pistons. We just need to seal it from the top – this is where the <em>cylinder head</em> comes in:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_head"></div>
<p>There are a lot of openings there. Firstly, notice four large sections at the bottom – these dome-like cavities will form the top of the combustion chamber. Each of those four sections is the same, so let&rsquo;s look at the individual segment up close:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_head_section"></div>
<p>In this engine each cylinder has four major openings – through two of them the intake air is sucked in and through the other two the exhaust gases are let out. If you <a href="index.html#" class="link_button" onclick="ice_head0();return false;">look</a> at the head from a side you&rsquo;ll notice that each pair of the openings is joined into one elliptical hole that exits on the side of the head. Those passages are known as intake and exhaust ports. Additionally, there is a <a href="index.html#" class="link_button" onclick="ice_head1();return false;">smaller hole</a> drilled centrally through the axis of each opening – they&rsquo;re there for the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>intake</strong></span> and <span class="ice_red"><strong>exhaust</strong></span> valves:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_head_valves"></div>
<div id="ice_head_valves_sl0"></div>
<p>Modern engines typically use more than one <span class="ice_blue"><strong>intake</strong></span> and <span class="ice_red"><strong>exhaust</strong></span> valves per cylinder as it increases the flow of gases in and out of the combustion chamber. Moreover, the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>intake</strong></span> valves are usually a little bigger:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_plain_valves"></div>
<p>When the piston moves down on an intake stroke, the pressure difference it creates is no larger than that of the incoming air, which, for traditional engines, is roughly equal to the atmospheric pressure. However, at the end of the combustion stroke the pressure inside the cylinder is many times higher than the atmospheric pressure, so it&rsquo;s significantly easier to expel the combustion gases than to suck the intake air in. For this reason the intake openings and valves are larger.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the operation of those valves up close. Firstly, the seal they form has to be very tight so that the only pathway for the expanding gases created in the combustion is to push the piston down. The edges of a <span class="ice_red"><strong>valve</strong></span> and its seat have a conical section so that the seal becomes tighter as the valve is pressed up:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_valve_seat"></div>
<div id="ice_valve_seat_sl0"></div>
<p>In our toy engine the valves magically opened and closed on their own, so let&rsquo;s see how it can be actually done in practice. To keep a valve shut we’re going to use a <span class="ice_blue"><strong>spring</strong></span> to keep tension on a closed <span class="ice_gray"><strong>valve</strong></span>. We can then lock the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>spring</strong></span> against the valve using simple locking mechanism that consists of two <span class="ice_red"><strong>valve keepers</strong></span>, a <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>spring retainer</strong></span>, and an <span class="ice_green"><strong>inverted bucket</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_valve_assembly"></div>
<div id="ice_valve_assembly_sl0"></div>
<p>Notice that the top part of a valve has a little groove in it so that the <span class="ice_red"><strong>keepers</strong></span> can lock in place. The <span class="ice_red"><strong>keepers</strong></span> themselves form a section of a cone that the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>retainer</strong></span> wedges against:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_valve_retainer"></div>
<div id="ice_valve_retainer_sl0"></div>
<p>Since the <span class="ice_red"><strong>keepers</strong></span> are locked in the grooves, the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>retainer</strong></span> can&rsquo;t move which holds the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>spring</strong></span> under tension. The <span class="ice_green"><strong>bucket</strong></span> provides a big and smooth surface for a force to transfer onto a valve – now whenever we push on the <span class="ice_green"><strong>bucket</strong></span> the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>spring</strong></span>  will push it back in place:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_valve_spring"></div>
<div class="ice_green" id="ice_valve_spring_sl0"></div>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the return mechanism all figured out, but this still leaves the problem of actually pressing the valves – they need to be opened at a certain cadence which depends on the movement of the piston inside the cylinder. That periodic nature of the operation implies that we should use some sort of rotary motion to push the valves.</p>
<p>We can shape a piece of metal so that it pushes on the valve at different offsets as it rotates on a <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>shaft</strong></span> – it&rsquo;s known as a <em>cam</em>. The <span class="ice_blue"><strong>spring</strong></span> ensures that the <span class="ice_green"><strong>bucket</strong></span> is tightly pressed against the <span class="ice_red"><strong>cam</strong></span> and follows its shape:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_cam"></div>
<div class="ice_yellow" id="ice_cam_sl0"></div>
<p>The shape of the cam defines when, for how long, and how much the valve is opened. In the demonstration below you can control the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>height</strong></span> and <span class="ice_red"><strong>angular span</strong></span> of the section of the cam profile that <span style="color:#666"><strong>deviates from a circle</strong></span> and see how it affects the position of the <span class="ice_green"><strong>bucket</strong></span> and thus valve <em>lift</em> at different <span class="ice_blue"><strong>angles</strong></span>. The plot in the upper part shows the offset of the <span class="ice_green"><strong>bucket</strong></span> relative to its normal position as the function of cam <span class="ice_blue"><strong>rotation angle</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_cam_shape"></div>
<div class="ice_yellow" id="ice_cam_shape_sl0"></div>
<div class="ice_red" id="ice_cam_shape_sl1"></div>
<div class="ice_blue" id="ice_cam_shape_sl2"></div>
<p>The shape of the cam is critical for defining the way the engine operates. All cams for a set of intake or exhaust valves are usually placed on a single <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>camshaft</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_camshaft"></div>
<p>Most modern engines use two <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>camshafts</strong></span>, one for <span class="ice_blue"><strong>intake valves</strong></span> and another for <span class="ice_red"><strong>exhaust valves</strong></span>. Let&rsquo;s see how the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>camshafts</strong></span> open and close valves during a typical engine operation:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_valves"></div>
<p>All cylinders go through four stages in a predefined order. The timing of the valves is actually not as straightforward as it was in our toy engine so let&rsquo;s look at it up close:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_valve_timing"></div>
<div id="ice_valve_timing_sl0"></div>
<p>Firstly, notice that the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>intake valves</strong></span> close <em>after</em> the piston reaches the bottom end of the <span class="ice_stroke">intake stroke</span> – the air coming through the valve has some inertia, which, especially at high engine speeds, makes it pile up in the cylinder despite the opposite movement of the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>piston</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <span class="ice_red"><strong>exhaust valves</strong></span> open before the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>piston</strong></span> reaches the bottom of the <span class="ice_stroke">power stroke</span>, as the majority of the useful work has already been done by the gases and the pressure surplus in the cylinder should be minimized so that the <span class="ice_stroke">exhaust stroke</span> doesn&rsquo;t have to actively compress the exhaust gases.</p>
<p>The <span class="ice_blue"><strong>intake valves</strong></span> open <em>slightly</em> before the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>piston</strong></span> reaches the top end of the <span class="ice_stroke">exhaust stroke</span>. When combustion gases escape through the <span class="ice_red"><strong>exhaust valves</strong></span> they help to create a &ldquo;scavenging&rdquo; effect that helps to pull the intake air in. For that reason the <span class="ice_red"><strong>exhaust valves</strong></span> close after the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>piston</strong></span> reaches the top of the <span class="ice_stroke">exhaust stroke</span>.</p>
<p>An engine running at low speed may have a different ideal parameters than an engine running at full speed, so many modern engines use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5dy2Vnf95w">a few methods</a> to vary both the timing and lift of the valves during operation.</p>
<p>We can now assemble the pieces together. While the top surface of the engine block and the bottom surface of the cylinder head are very flat and smooth, they need to form a perfect seal as they have to prevent the combustion gases from leaking through. A <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>gasket</strong></span>, often made from a softer, compressible metal, is placed in-between the two and the head is <span class="ice_red"><strong>bolted</strong></span> to the block:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_head_assembly"></div>
<div id="ice_head_assembly_sl0"></div>
<p>The <span class="ice_red"><strong>bolts</strong></span> are tightened to the predetermined torque in multiple steps and in a specific order to ensure that the head doesn&rsquo;t deform during assembly. The sturdiness of the head <span class="ice_red"><strong>bolts</strong></span> is critical as they literally have to contain the force of the explosions inside the cylinder.</p>
<p>The <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>camshafts</strong></span> are then installed – they&rsquo;re held in place by their <span class="ice_green"><strong>caps</strong></span> and <span class="ice_red"><strong>bolts</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_cam_assembly"></div>
<div id="ice_cam_assembly_sl0"></div>
<p>The only remaining piece of the puzzle is to how to turn the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>camshafts</strong></span> while ensuring they&rsquo;re synchronized to the movement of the pistons. To achieve this, most engines use a rubber <span class="ice_blue"><strong>timing belt</strong></span> that is driven by a <span class="ice_green"><strong>gear</strong></span> mounted to the crankshaft itself. The <span class="ice_blue"><strong>timing belt</strong></span> is teethed so that it locks in the notches on the <span class="ice_red"><strong>timing gears</strong></span>, the <span class="ice_dark_gray"><strong>rollers</strong></span> keep the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>belt</strong></span> in tension:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_cam_belt"></div>
<p>Recall that in a four stroke engine a single cycle of operation requires two full revolutions of the crankshaft as the piston goes through <span class="ice_stroke">intake</span>, <span class="ice_stroke">compression</span>, <span class="ice_stroke">power</span>, and <span class="ice_stroke">exhaust</span> phases. However, the intake and exhaust valves open just once during that cycle so the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>camshafts</strong></span> should do just a <em>single</em> revolution during that time.</p>
<p>To fulfill this requirement the <span class="ice_green"><strong>crankshaft gear</strong></span> is twice as small as the <span class="ice_red"><strong>camshaft gears</strong></span> – this ensures that the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>camshafts</strong></span> rotate just once when the crankshaft rotates twice which you can verify by observing a small <span style="color:#000"><strong>black</strong></span> dots at the perimeter of the gears:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_cam_belt2"></div>
<div class="ice_green" id="ice_cam_belt2_sl0"></div>
<h1 id="combustion">Combustion<a href="index.html#combustion" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><img src="../images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"/></a> </h1>
<p>In the examples so far we’ve assumed that the intake valve let in a mixture of air and fuel, and that indeed was the case in older engines that used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carburetor">carburetor</a> to create the mix.</p>
<p>Modern engines, however, use a fuel injection system where the amount and timing of fuel injection is controlled by an electronic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_control_unit">Engine Control Unit</a>, often abbreviated as ECU. At appropriate time the solenoid inside the injector is <span class="ice_green"><strong>energized</strong></span> which electromagnetically pulls the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>needle</strong></span> up, which in turns lets the pressurized fuel escape through the tiny outlet holes. When the power to the solenoid is <span style="color:#7f7f7f"><strong>cut</strong></span>, the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>spring</strong></span> pushes the needle back to seal the nozzle:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_injector"></div>
<p>In some engines the injection happens in the intake port, very close to the intake valve itself, but in our engine we&rsquo;ll use a direct injection system in which the fuel is put directly into the cylinder itself.</p>
<p>The fuel and air mixture in the combustion chamber is lit by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark_plug"><em>spark plug</em></a>. In a simplified form a spark plug consists of two pieces of metal separated by a  <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>ceramic insulator</strong></span>. The <span class="ice_green"><strong>outer shell</strong></span> is connected to the engine body which acts as a ground, and the <span class="ice_red"><strong>central electrode</strong></span> is connected to a source of voltage  high enough to bridge the gap to the tip of the <span class="ice_green"><strong>outer shell</strong></span> which creates a spark:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_spark_plug"></div>
<p>That high voltage is generated by an ignition coil. In older engines there was a single coil that sequentially provided high voltage to individual spark plugs, but in modern engines each spark plug will usually have its own coil with the discharge controlled by the ECU.</p>
<p>With a set of <span class="ice_blue"><strong>injectors</strong></span> and <span class="ice_red"><strong>spark plugs</strong></span> in hand we can finally fill the remaining holes in the engine head. I&rsquo;ll hide the rest of the engine so that we get a better view as to where they fit:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_sparks_injectors"></div>
<div id="ice_sparks_injectors_sl0"></div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how an <span class="ice_blue"><strong>injector</strong></span> and a <span class="ice_red"><strong>spark plug</strong></span> work together during the strokes. Note that normally the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>injector</strong></span> is attached to a fuel rail feeding it highly pressurized gasoline and a <span class="ice_red"><strong>spark plug</strong></span> is connected to its coil, but for the sake of clarity they&rsquo;re not being shown here. The air is depicted as a blue gas that turns yellow when mixed with fuel:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_spark"></div>
<p>You may notice that the <span class="ice_red"><strong>spark plug</strong></span> fires before the piston reaches the end of the compression phase – it&rsquo;s done on purpose since it takes a moment for the burning of the air-fuel mixture to begin. Let&rsquo;s take a look at all four cylinders firing in sequence:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_firing"></div>
<p>All the demonstrations in this article run at very slow speeds, but it&rsquo;s worth mentioning how fast things happen in an actual car. For an engine running at a modest speed of 1500 revolutions per minute there are 25 revolutions of the crankshaft every <em>second</em>. Each cylinder fires once per two revolutions of the crankshaft, but since we have four cylinders, there are actually around 50 explosions per second happening in an engine running at that speed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air%E2%80%93fuel_ratio">ratio of air to fuel</a> in the combustion chamber is important as simply adding more fuel doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make the cylinder pressure bigger as we&rsquo;ll just end up with incompletely burnt gasoline. To actually increase the speed of the engine we need to increase the supply of fuel <em>and</em> air.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the pressure inside the cylinder a bit closer. During the intake stroke the piston creates a negative pressure difference which sucks the air in. During the compression stroke the pressure increases due to shrinking volume, only to increase even more due to combustion. It&rsquo;s finally reduced by the expanding volume of the chamber as the piston goes down during the power stroke:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_pressure"></div>
<div id="ice_pressure_sl0"></div>
<p>The pushing force generated on the piston is proportional to the pressure in the cylinder, however, the <em>torque</em> generated by that force is also affected by other factors. Firstly, observe that during the compression stroke, the pressure inside the chamber pushes on the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>piston</strong></span> and through the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>rod</strong></span> <em>against</em> the rotation of the <span class="ice_green"><strong>crankshaft</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_crankshaft_pressure"></div>
<div class="ice_green" id="ice_crankshaft_pressure_sl0"></div>
<p>Secondly, the magnitude of torque depends on the effective length of the arm of force, but that length changes during crankshaft rotation. For instance, when the <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>piston</strong></span> is at the top dead center the gases merely push the <span class="ice_green"><strong>crankshaft</strong></span> down, but they don&rsquo;t <em>turn</em> it because the force arm has the length of zero. In the demonstration below the <span class="ice_red_dashed">red dashed line</span> shows the direction of the <span class="ice_blue"><strong>rod</strong></span> force and the <span style="color:#000"><strong>black line</strong></span> show the arm of force on the crank:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_crankshaft_torque"></div>
<div id="ice_crankshaft_torque_sl0"></div>
<p>If we account for these effects we can calculate that the torque generated by the pressure inside one cylinder is roughly as follows:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_pressure_torque"></div>
<div id="ice_pressure_torque_sl0"></div>
<p>However, these are not all the forces that affect the crankshaft. Both piston and its connecting rod have some mass and during crankshaft&rsquo;s rotation they keep changing their direction of motion. Let&rsquo;s look at the plot of the velocity of a piston as it moves up and down the cylinder when the crankshaft rotates with a constant angular velocity:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_piston_velocity"></div>
<div id="ice_piston_velocity_sl0"></div>
<p>You may be surprised that the plot isn&rsquo;t symmetrical, but it&rsquo;s just a consequence of the already discussed behavior of the crank mechanism taking more time to move through the lower half of the stroke compared to the upper half of the stroke.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider a piston in a top dead center position – as the piston reaches that point its velocity is 0, so the crankshaft has to drag the piston down. Roughly halfway through its stroke the piston reaches its maximum velocity, and now the crankshaft has to actually slow the piston down so that it stops moving by the time it reaches the bottom dead center position. The piston, however, wants to keep going, so it exerts a pushing force. These inertial forces keep oscillating back and forth creating an inertial torque on the crankshaft:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_inertia_torque"></div>
<div id="ice_inertia_torque_sl0"></div>
<p>The magnitude of the inertial forces depends on the speed of the piston and thus on the crankshaft&rsquo;s rotational velocity. That system is very dynamic since crankshaft&rsquo;s rotational velocity in turn is affected by the inertial forces acting on it.</p>
<p>The resulting output crankshaft&rsquo;s torque is a sum of these pressure-based and inertia-based torques. The cumulative diagram of torque on the crankshaft from a single piston looks roughly like this:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_total_torque"></div>
<div id="ice_total_torque_sl0"></div>
<p>As you can see, the torque created by a single piston is very varied. Even when we overlap the resulting torque from all four pistons the total torque is still fairly uneven:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_total4_torque"></div>
<div id="ice_total4_torque_sl0"></div>
<p>A torque <strong>T</strong> acting on a shaft creates an angular acceleration <strong>α</strong> that is proportional to that torque:</p>
<div class="equation">
T = I &middot; &alpha;
</div>
<p>This is a rotational equivalent of traditional linear equation that ties force <strong>F</strong> to mass <strong>m</strong> and linear acceleration <strong>a</strong>:</p>
<div class="equation">
F = m &middot; a
</div>
<p>In rotational motion the equivalent of mass <strong>m</strong> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia"><em>moment of inertia</em></a> <strong>I</strong>. Similarly to how velocity is affected by acceleration, <em>angular</em> velocity is affected by <em>angular</em> acceleration. Let&rsquo;s see how angular velocity of the crankshaft varies over time under a constant load:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_ang_vel"></div>
<div id="ice_ang_vel_sl0"></div>
<p>As you can see the value fluctuates a lot. To reduce the angular acceleration and thus variation in angular velocity we have to increase the rotational inertia <strong>I</strong> of the system. For that purpose a heavy <span class="ice_red"><strong>flywheel</strong></span> is attached to the crankshaft with a bunch of  <span class="ice_yellow"><strong>bolts</strong></span>:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_flywheel_assembly"></div>
<div id="ice_flywheel_assembly_sl0"></div>
<p>Because the <span class="ice_red"><strong>flywheel</strong></span>  is heavy and has a large moment of inertia the variation in angular velocity of the crankshaft is reduced which makes the engine work more evenly:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_ang_vel_red"></div>
<div id="ice_ang_vel_red_sl0"></div>
<p>Notice that the <span class="ice_red"><strong>flywheel</strong></span> has gear teeth cut on its perimeter. Those teeth mesh with a <span class="ice_green"><strong>pinion gear</strong></span> that is powered by an electric starter motor when the engine is being turned on.</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="ice_starter"></div>
<div class="ice_green" id="ice_starter_sl0"></div>
<p>Once the <span class="ice_red"><strong>flywheel</strong></span> starts moving its inertia helps to keep the crankshaft going which in turn lets the engine continue to operate on its own. Note that while the high inertia of the <span class="ice_red"><strong>flywheel</strong></span> helps to smooth out the variation in angular velocity, it also comes at a cost – a very heavy <span class="ice_red"><strong>flywheel</strong></span> is difficult to spin up so the engine becomes less responsive to throttle input.</p>
<p>In cars with manual transmission an engaged clutch presses against the flywheel to transfer the rotational motion to the transmission and further down to the wheels. Cars with automatic transmission don&rsquo;t have a flywheel but instead they use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexplate"><em>flexplate</em></a> which is connected to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque_converter">torque converter</a> which serves as a source of large inertia to smooth out the engine&rsquo;s efforts.</p>
<p>The journey through our engine ends here, but there are still many components needed to fully embed an engine in a car. The previously mentioned cooling system ensures the engine is kept at an appropriate operating temperature. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inlet_manifold">intake</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaust_manifold">exhaust</a> manifolds direct the flow of gases into and out of the cylinders. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_pump_(internal_combustion_engine)">oil pump</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_filter">oil filter</a>, and oil passages in the engine block and cylinder head ensure all components are properly lubricated. Many modern engines also employ a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger">turbocharger</a> that uses the exhaust gases to increase the amount of air that gets pushed into the cylinders. All those components make sure that the engine can operate at expected level of power and efficiency.</p>

<p>Unchallenged for decades, the internal combustion engines in cars are slowly being supplanted by their electric equivalents, which are simpler, quieter, and more environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>Despite their drawbacks, classic engines still have something mythical about them – their intricate mechanisms are synchronized together to create carefully controlled conditions for harnessing fire in a truly Promethean way.</p>
