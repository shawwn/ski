    <h1 class="post_title"><a href="index.html">Gears</a></h1>
    <div class="padding_wrapper"><p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by mechanical gears. There is something captivating about the way their teeth come together to create a fluid, unified motion:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_demo"></div>
<p>In this blog post I&rsquo;d like to look at these simple machines up close. I&rsquo;ll explain how gears affect the properties of rotational motion and how the shape of their teeth is way more sophisticated than it may initially seem.</p>
<p>Movement is important in this article so most of the visualizations are animated – you can play and pause them by <span class="click_word">clicking</span><span class="tap_word">tapping</span> on the button in their bottom left corner. By default the animations are <span id="global_animate_on">enabled, but if you find them distracting, or you want to save power, you can <a href="index.html#" class="link_button" onclick="global_animate(false);return false;">globally pause</a> all animations, just make sure to unpause them as needed.</span><span id="global_animate_off" class="hidden">disabled, but if you&rsquo;d prefer to have things moving as you read you can <a href="index.html#"  class="link_button" onclick="global_animate(true);return false;">globally unpause</a> them and see all the objects in their rotating glory.</span></p>
<h1 id="spinning">Spinning<a href="index.html#spinning" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><img src="../images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"/></a> </h1>
<p>On a hot summer day you might have enjoyed a cool breeze from a desk fan. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at this device. In the demonstration below you can control the fan&rsquo;s speed using a slider:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_angular_velocity"></div>
<div id="gears_angular_velocity_slider_container"></div>
<p>The speed of a rotating fan is a different kind of speed than that of a car – it describes how quickly a fan <em>rotates</em>. To distinguish that rotating movement from a simple linear motion we use the term <em>angular velocity</em>. Angular velocity describes how quickly an object rotates relative to some point. For mechanical devices like fans that point often corresponds to the center of a shaft on which the spinning part is mounted.</p>
<p>Angular velocity can be expressed in many units. In physics and math the most popular ones are <em>degrees per second</em> <span class="fainter">(°/s)</span> and <em>radians per second</em> <span class="fainter">(rad/s)</span> – they express the change in object&rsquo;s angle of rotation per unit of time:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_deg"></div>
<p>In engineering it&rsquo;s more common to use the unit of <em>revolutions per minute</em> or <em>rpm</em> for short. Older spinning hard drives rotated at 5,400 rpm while an internal combustion engine of an idling car may keep running at around 800 rpm. Almost by definition, the second hand of a clock rotates at 1 rpm.</p>
<p>All of °/s, rad/s, and rpm are equivalent – they&rsquo;re just one multiplication by a constant factor away from each other. Given the engineering nature of this article I&rsquo;ll stick to rpm, but I&rsquo;ll often skip the units completely since they won&rsquo;t be essential.</p>
<h1 id="disc">Disc<a href="index.html#disc" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><img src="../images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"/></a> </h1>
<p>Propeller-like shapes are exciting to look at, but they obscure some basic features of the rotational motion that we&rsquo;ll explore. Over the next few paragraphs we&rsquo;ll look at a more basic shape – a disc attached to a shaft. In the demonstration below you can control its angular velocity with a slider:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_rpm"></div>
<div id="gears_rpm_slider_container"></div>
<p>The small triangular indicator is there to help visualize the current orientation of the disc. I&rsquo;ve also painted six points on its surface. You may have already noticed that some of those points move more than the others even though the entire disc has the same angular velocity.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s investigate what&rsquo;s going on by controlling the time back and forth with a slider. As the disc rotates the points leave a trace of the path they followed:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_arc_distance"></div>
<div id="gears_arc_distance_slider_container"></div>
<p>At the bottom part of the simulation you can see the flattened arcs of the paths traced by the six points. Notably, as the disc rotates the distances traveled by the points further away from the center are larger than those of the points closer to the center. Coincidentally, the triangular pattern of the flattened out arcs is also a simple way to <a href="https://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/RABH.shtml">derive</a> the area of a circle.</p>
<p>All paths are traversed in the same amount of time, but their lengths differ signaling that the points have different <em>velocity</em>. Notice that we&rsquo;re talking about a different kind of velocity now. The disc and all the points on it have the same <em>angular</em> velocity, but different points at different radii have different <em>linear</em> velocities.</p>
<p>In the demonstration below you can observe how the arrows, which represent the linear velocities of the six points, change depending on the disc&rsquo;s angular velocity and the points' distances from the center:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_linear_velocity"></div>
<div id="gears_linear_velocity_slider_container"></div>
<p>The instantaneous linear velocity <strong>v</strong> of a point on a rotating object depends on the distance <strong>r</strong> to the center of rotation and the angular velocity <strong>ω</strong>:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
v = &omega; &middot; r
</div>
<p>A linear velocity of a point rotating around the center of rotation is perpendicular to the direction towards the center. As a side note, observe that while the linear velocity vector constantly changes its <em>direction</em> due to <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/centripetal-force-and-gravitation/centripetal-acceleration-tutoria/a/what-is-centripetal-acceleration">centripetal acceleration</a>, its <em>magnitude</em> remains the same.</p>
<h1 id="transmission">Transmission<a href="index.html#transmission" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><img src="../images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"/></a> </h1>
<p>So far we&rsquo;ve been looking at just a single rotating disc, but let&rsquo;s try to complicate things a little by adding a second disc to our setup. I&rsquo;ll place it so that the side surfaces of the discs are pressing against each other. In the demonstration below the <em>driving</em> yellow disc is powered by some engine, which I&rsquo;ve indicated using a rotating arrow near the shaft. You can observe what happens to the green disc that isn&rsquo;t powered by anything:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_contact"></div>
<p>The two discs aren&rsquo;t perfectly slick, their surfaces have some roughness to them which creates friction when the sides touch. That friction at the contact point between two discs is making them temporarily stick to each other. This causes the right circle to be &ldquo;dragged&rdquo; along for the ride. At some point the curvature of the discs pulls the connection apart, but as that happens new points on the surfaces of the discs are coming into contact again.</p>
<p>Observe how the two discs rotate in different directions – as one turns clockwise the other one rotates counterclockwise. Moreover, due to sticking at the point of contact the velocities of the side surfaces of both discs are the same. All the points on those sides trace the same arcs in the same period of time.</p>
<p>In that simple scenario as the driving disc completed a full turn, so did the driven disc. Things become more interesting when the discs have <em>different</em> radii. Let&rsquo;s look at the paths that two points on the surfaces of these discs trace:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_contact_small"></div>
<div id="gears_contact_small_slider_container"></div>
<p>Since the linear velocities of the points are the same, the paths end up having the same length. However, this causes the bigger disc to rotate by fewer degrees since its circumference is larger. In this configuration, when a small disc does a full turn the big one does <em>half</em> a turn. The <em>angular</em> velocity of the right disc is <em>smaller</em>.</p>
<p>We can reach the same conclusion by looking at the velocity of the &ldquo;sticking&rdquo; point. The linear velocity <strong>v<sub>in</sub></strong> as seen by the <strong>in</strong>put disc is:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
v<sub>in</sub> = &omega;<sub>in</sub> &middot; r<sub>in</sub>
</div>
<p>While the linear velocity <strong>v<sub>out</sub></strong> of the <strong>out</strong>put disc is:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
v<sub>out</sub> = &omega;<sub>out</sub> &middot; r<sub>out</sub>
</div>
<p>Since these velocities are the same we can simply equate them:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
&omega;<sub>in</sub> &middot; r<sub>in</sub> = &omega;<sub>out</sub> &middot; r<sub>out</sub>
</div>
<p>To finally derive that the angular velocity of the output disc is proportional to the angular velocity of the input disc:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">&omega;<sub>out</sub></span> = <span>&omega;<sub>in</sub></span> &middot; <span class="gear_frac"><span>r<sub>in</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">r<sub>out</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<p>The smaller the input disc, the smaller the output angular velocity, and the smaller the output disc, the <em>larger</em> its angular velocity.</p>
<p>In the demonstration below the left driving disc always rotates with the same angular velocity, but the angular velocity of the right disc is affected by the ratio of radii of the two wheels:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_resize"></div>
<div id="gears_resize_slider_container"></div>
<p>The speed of the driven green disc can change quite drastically depending on the ratio of the radii. We&rsquo;ve devised a very simple mechanism that allows us to modify the angular velocity from one shaft to another. However, it&rsquo;s not all this contraption is doing.</p>
<h1 id="torque">Torque<a href="index.html#torque" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><img src="../images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"/></a> </h1>
<p>The next time you tighten a nut with a wrench try to see how the force needed to move it depends on the point at which you apply the force. The demonstration below shows roughly how big of a force would be needed:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_spanner"></div>
<div id="gears_spanner_slider_container"></div>
<p>The further away from the nut you press the lesser the force needed and the easier it becomes to tighten the nut. If you don&rsquo;t have a wrench and a nut handy, you can try to open a door by pressing it very close to the hinge. It&rsquo;s much harder to do compared to pushing the door near the handle – the capability to turn is much smaller.</p>
<p>This turning effect of a force is called <em>torque</em> and it depends on both the applied force <strong>F</strong> and the length of the lever arm <strong>r</strong>:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">T</span> = <span>r &middot; F<sub>t</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<p>Notice the little <sub><strong>t</strong></sub> subscript next to the force – it represents the <em>tangential</em> component of the force. In the demonstration below you can control the angle of the applied <span style="color:#888;"><strong>gray</strong></span> force, however, only the <span style="color:#E03232;"><strong>red</strong></span> tangential component that is perpendicular to the arm ends up counting towards the torque:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_tangent"></div>
<div id="gears_tangent_slider_container"></div>
<p>Notice how the magnitude of torque increases and decreases as the force rotates. When the force starts pushing the wrench in the opposite direction the torque changes sign because it also changes the clockwiseness of the rotation of the wrench.</p>
<p>The alternative way to look at the tangential component is to find a circle that is tangent to the line of force and use its radius <strong>r<sub>t</sub></strong> as the basis for the torque calculation:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_tangent_circle"></div>
<div id="gears_tangent_circle_slider_container"></div>
<p>As such, torque can also be expressed using this form:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">T</span> = <span>r<sub>t</sub> &middot; F</span>
</span>
</div>
<p>Both approaches to look at this problem are equivalent as they ultimately end up being described by the same equation in which <strong>α</strong> represents the angle between the force and the arm:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">T</span> = <span>r &middot; F &middot; sin(&alpha;)</span>
</span>
</div>
<p>So far we&rsquo;ve discussed how a force acting on a perpendicular arm creates a torque. However, if a torque is already present on a shaft, e.g. exerted by an engine or a crank, then that torque will apply a force at a distance.</p>
<p>In the demonstration below a disc has a spool attached to it on which a rope is wound. The disc has a constant input torque, but as the radius of the spool changes so does the force with which the rope is pulled:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_torque_rope0"></div>
<div id="gears_torque_rope0_slider_container"></div>
<p>When two friction discs are working together the driving one drags the driven one with some force, so let&rsquo;s see how the torque is affected by the interaction between two discs. A torque <strong>T<sub>in</sub></strong> on an <strong>in</strong>put shaft causes the disc to exert force <strong>F</strong> at a distance <strong>r<sub>in</sub></strong>:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">F</span> = <span class="gear_frac"><span>T<sub>in</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">r<sub>in</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<p>That very same force acts on the <strong>out</strong>put disc at a distance <strong>r<sub>out</sub></strong>:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">F</span> = <span class="gear_frac"><span>T<sub>out</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">r<sub>out</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<p>We can equate the two:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac"><span>T<sub>in</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">r<sub>in</sub></span></span> = <span class="gear_frac"><span>T<sub>out</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">r<sub>out</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<p>To finally derive that the output torque is proportional to the input torque:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">T<sub>out</sub></span> = <span>T<sub>in</sub></span> &middot; <span class="gear_frac"><span>r<sub>out</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">r<sub>in</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the equation for the output torque with the equation for the output angular velocity:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">&omega;<sub>out</sub></span> = <span>&omega;<sub>in</sub></span> &middot; <span class="gear_frac"><span>r<sub>in</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">r<sub>out</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<p>Notice that the ratios of the radii are inverted. We can now see how the torque and angular velocity are affected in an actual disc setup. In the simulation below you can control the ratio of radii of the two discs. The right disc has a spool with a rope attached to it. Since the spool is attached to the disc the torque and the angular velocity are transferred directly to it:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_torque_rope"></div>
<div id="gears_torque_rope_slider_container"></div>
<p>Notice that when the yellow <em>driving</em> gear gets smaller the torque on the output disc increases and as a result so does the force with which the rope is pulled. On the other hand, as the <em>driven</em> gear gets smaller its angular velocity increases and so does the linear velocity of the rope.</p>
<p>By using two discs of different radii we can use a single engine to drive the input and have vastly different outcomes at the output. Depending on the use case we may want to sacrifice some speed to be able to pull the rope with a lot of force, or prioritize the output velocity at the cost of a weaker pulling capability.</p>
<h1 id="gears">Gears<a href="index.html#gears" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><img src="../images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"/></a> </h1>
<p>The friction discs systems we played with so far work perfectly in idealized scenarios, but in practice they&rsquo;re quite flawed. As soon as the two discs are not in a close contact due to vibration, wear on the touching surfaces, or even manufacturing imprecision, they&rsquo;ll start slipping. The assumption about the sticking contact point breaks and the mechanism no longer transfers angular velocity and torque as needed:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_slip"></div>
<p>This problem can be solved by ensuring that the driving wheel physically <em>pushes</em> the driven wheel. This is where gears come in. Because the teeth of two <em>meshed</em> gears are interlocked with each other, the driving gear ends up pressing directly against the driven gear:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_gears"></div>
<div id="gears_gears_slider_container"></div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example of two gears of different sizes meshing with each other. Naturally, for two gears to be compatible their teeth have to be of the same size – the distance between two subsequent teeth known as <em>circular pitch</em> has to be the same. In the demonstration below each gear has its circular pitches marked with short arc segments. Notice down below that those arcs flattened out have the same length:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_pitch"></div>
<div id="gears_pitch_slider_container"></div>
<p>A full circular set of colorful segments forms a so-called <em>pitch circle</em>. A pitch circle represents an idealized circle that is in contact with the other gear&rsquo;s pitch circle. They both correspond to the simple friction-based disc systems we&rsquo;ve already discussed.</p>
<p>Pitch circles let us look past the complexity of the interlocking gears by reducing their form to the familiar teethless discs on which we can used the radius-based equations. However, using the size of gear&rsquo;s radii or diameter is cumbersome, especially since the pitch circle isn&rsquo;t visible.</p>
<p>In practice, it&rsquo;s more common to refer to gears by using their number of teeth <strong>N</strong> and the size of those teeth. In the United States the term <em>diametral pitch</em> is used to define the teeth size, it is obtained by dividing the number of teeth <strong>N</strong> by the diameter <strong>d</strong> of the pitch circle.</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">diametral pitch</span> = <span class="gear_frac"><span>N</span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">d</span>
</span>
</div>
<p>In other countries a similar, but inverted ratio called <em>module</em> is used instead:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">module</span> = <span class="gear_frac"><span>d</span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">N</span>
</span>
</div>
<p>Both diametral pitch and module effectively define the <em>size</em> of the teeth. Since those parameters in the two matching gears have to be the same we can equate them:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
 <span class="gear_frac"><span>N<sub>in</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">d<sub>in</sub></span></span> = <span class="gear_frac"><span>N<sub>out</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">d<sub>out</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<p>With just a simple transformation we can derive that the ratio of the number of teeth is equivalent to the ratio of the diameters, or the radii, of the pitch circles:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
 <span class="gear_frac"><span>N<sub>in</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">N<sub>out</sub></span></span> = <span class="gear_frac"><span>d<sub>in</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">d<sub>out</sub></span>
</span>
 = <span class="gear_frac"><span>r<sub>in</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">r<sub>out</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<p>As a result we can talk about a transmission system using number of teeth on the meshing gears instead of specifying their diameters or radii:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">T<sub>out</sub></span> = <span>T<sub>in</sub></span> &middot; <span class="gear_frac"><span>N<sub>out</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">N<sub>in</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">&omega;<sub>out</sub></span> = <span>&omega;<sub>in</sub></span> &middot; <span class="gear_frac"><span>N<sub>in</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">N<sub>out</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<p>In the demonstration below you can adjust the <em>diametral pitch</em>, i.e. the size of the teeth of the two meshed gears to see that the constant ratio of the numbers of teeth indeed maintains the constant ratio of angular velocity:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_dp"></div>
<div id="gears_dp_slider_container"></div>
<h1 id="tangent--normal">Tangent &amp; Normal<a href="index.html#tangent--normal" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><img src="../images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"/></a> </h1>
<p>So far I&rsquo;ve conveniently avoided describing the details of the shape of the teeth of a gear, but it&rsquo;s actually one of the most important aspects of a gear system. Before we take a closer look at the profile of a tooth we have to discuss the concept of a <em>tangent</em> to a curve.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent">tangent</a> can be described in a few different ways, but one of the most intuitive ones is to imagine three beads sliding on said curve. The red bead symbolizes a point on the curve at which we want to find the tangency. The two blue beads neighbor the red bead at its sides:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_curve"></div>
<div id="gears_curve0_slider_container"></div>
<div id="gears_curve1_slider_container"></div>
<p>As the blue beads get closer and closer to the red bead, the line spanned through their centers approaches the line of tangency at that red point. The tangent line shows the local &ldquo;straight ahead&rdquo; direction on the curve. In the limit, the imaginary beads completely overlap and the tangent locally touches the curve at just a <em>single</em> point which explains the origin of the word – in Latin <em>tangere</em> means &ldquo;to touch&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A closely related concept to a tangent line is a <em>normal</em> line which is perpendicular to the tangent at that point. In the demonstration below you can see the <span class="dotted">dotted</span> normal and the <span style="text-decoration:underline">solid</span> tangent lines of two curves:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_curve_normal"></div>
<div id="gears_curve_normal_slider_container"></div>
<p>When two curves <a href="index.html#" class="link_button" onclick="gears_curve_touch();return false;">touch</a> at a single point, their lines of tangency, and thus normals, are the same. If it wasn&rsquo;t the case then a line of tangency of one curve would intersect the other curve in more than one place and the shapes would be overlapping instead of meeting at just a singular location.</p>
<p>This observation is important when we consider the point of contact between two teeth. Let&rsquo;s see it up close:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_normal"></div>
<div id="gears_normal_slider_container"></div>
<p>The <span style="color:#000;"><strong>black</strong></span> point represents a <em>pitch point</em> – a point at which the two pitch circles of the gears touch.
The <span style="color:#EB2D2D;"><strong>red</strong></span> point represents the point of contact between two teeth – notice how it moves across the surfaces of the teeth. The <span style="text-decoration:underline">solid</span> line shows the tangent line of the outline of two teeth at the point of contact and the normal is represented by the <span class="dotted">dotted</span> line.</p>
<p>The only useful component of the contact force between the two gears will be acting in the direction of that normal – that&rsquo;s the pushing force which I depicted using the black arrow. You may wonder if the fact that the direction of the force in the previous demonstration is tilted matters. After all, it may affect the transfer of torque.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at this problem in a little more detail. Since transmission features of gears are ultimately decided by their pitch circles we can simplify the situation by analyzing the effective pitch circles of the teeth-less discs when the force changes direction:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_force_angle"></div>
<div id="gears_force_angle_slider_container"></div>
<p>When we discussed torque we already observed that when the force changes direction the radius of the circle tangent to that force also changes. However, the radii of <em>both</em> discs are scaled by the same factor of <strong>cos(α)</strong>, where <strong>α</strong> is the <em>pressure angle</em> controlled by the slider in the simulation above:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">T<sub>out</sub></span> = <span>T<sub>in</sub></span> &middot; <span class="gear_frac"><span>r<sub>out</sub>&middot;cos(&alpha;)</span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">r<sub>in</sub>&middot;cos(&alpha;)</span>
</span>
</div>
<p>In effect, the cosine factors cancel out and the constant ratio of torque transfer is maintained. In the example above the line of force always passed through the black pitch point in the center. In the simulation below you can witness what happens to the effective circle radii when the line of force does <em>not</em> go through the pitch point:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_force_offset"></div>
<div id="gears_force_offset_slider_container"></div>
<p>As you can see, if the acting force doesn&rsquo;t lie on the line through the pitch point one of the circles effectively grows while the other one effectively shrinks. The constant torque ratio is <em>not</em> maintained since the ratio of the effective radii also changes.</p>
<p>A very similar line of thinking can be done for the rate of change of angular velocity. A point of contact between two gears has some linear velocity related to the rotational motion of the discs. Since the two teeth remain in contact, the components of the velocities in the direction of the normal have to be the same, otherwise the teeth would separate.</p>
<p>From here the reasoning is equivalent to our analysis of forces – if you&rsquo;re interested you can follow a <a href="https://eng-resources.uncc.edu/unccengkit/mechanical/gears/law-of-gearing/">more rigorous derivation</a> that I found. The final conclusions for both angular velocity and torque are the same and our discussion of the surface normals helps us define the <em>law of gearing</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To ensure a constant ratio of angular velocity and torque modification the surface normals of teeth at all points of contact have to go through the pitch point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As long as that condition is met, the tooth profiles can be arbitrary. However, in practice a very specific curve is used to define the shape of a gear&rsquo;s teeth. Let&rsquo;s see how it&rsquo;s created.</p>
<h1 id="strings-attached">Strings Attached<a href="index.html#strings-attached" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><img src="../images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"/></a> </h1>
<p>The tooth shape we&rsquo;re looking for should ensure that its normal at any point of meshing will point at the pitch point. We could let the normal change direction over time, but to make things simpler we can just define a single line on which all normals will lie. We could look at this setup through equations, but thankfully a much more pleasant approach exists.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll take two discs, wrap a string around them, and we&rsquo;ll nail that string to the discs' sides so that it follows their movement. Let&rsquo;s see what happens when we put a little perpendicular <span style="color:#E03232;"><strong>red</strong></span> marker on that string and start unwinding it from one disc and winding it onto another. I attached a piece of paper to the underside of the yellow disc so that we can see the trail left by the marker as the disc rotates:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_involute"></div>
<div id="gears_involute_slider_container"></div>
<p>The straight part of the string represents the normal – that&rsquo;s the direction in which the pushing force will act. For the force to act in this way the tangent of the curve should be <em>perpendicular</em> to the string at all times. However, that&rsquo;s exactly what the red marker does – at every point of the curve it is perpendicular to the string, and thus it&rsquo;s perpendicular to the normal. The trail left on the paper is precisely the curve we were looking for.</p>
<p>We can look at this same situation from a point of view of the single disc, by unwinding a string with a marker from its surface:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_involute_string"></div>
<div id="gears_involute_string_slider_container"></div>
<p>The shape we&rsquo;ve created is called an <em>involute</em>. At every point of the curve its normal is tangent to the generating circle precisely because the taut string <em>is</em> that normal. If the teeth of two matching gears have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involute">involute</a> profile they meet the requirements of the law of gearing.</p>
<p>A shape of involute of the teeth in a gear is generated by the gear&rsquo;s <em>base circle</em>, which is <em>smaller</em> than its pitch circle. The smaller size of the base circle results in a non-zero pressure angle, the most commonly used value is 20°. As we&rsquo;ve seen this is perfectly fine since due to the shape of the involute the force is directed through the pitch point.</p>
<p>In the demonstration below you can see how a shape of teeth of an <em>idealized</em> gear is formed:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_involute_petals"></div>
<div id="gears_involute_petals_slider_container"></div>
<p>The shape starts at the <a href="index.html#" class="link_button" onclick="gears_dedendum();return false;">dedendum circle</a> which defines the bottom outline of the teeth roots. From here the teeth grow radially in <span style="color:#1F6AEA;"><strong>blue</strong></span> straight lines – these areas of the teeth are never in contact with the teeth of the other gear.</p>
<p>Once the <a href="index.html#" class="link_button" onclick="gears_base();return false;">base circle</a> is reached, the <span style="color:#EB2D2D;"><strong>red</strong></span> involute shape begins – from every side an imaginary string is being unwound. The magic marker at the end of the string passes through the <a href="index.html#" class="link_button" onclick="gears_pitch();return false;">pitch circle</a>, which corresponds to the idealized friction disc, only to end at the <a href="index.html#" class="link_button" onclick="gears_addendum();return false;">addendum circle</a> which defines the outline of the teeth tips.</p>
<p>In practice, the bottom part of the tooth would join the dedendum circle with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fillet_(mechanics)">fillet</a> to avoid stress concentration and its shape would be heavily influenced by the way a gear is manufactured. The widths of the teeth would also be slightly narrower to allow some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash_(engineering)">backlash</a> to prevent jamming.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about involute gears is that even for the same size of teeth, as measured by diametral pitch or module, the shape of a tooth of a given gear strongly depends on the gear&rsquo;s radius. In the simulation below the <span style="color:#39C085;"><strong>green</strong></span> line shows the pitch circle, the <span style="color:#F74D4D;"><strong>red</strong></span> line shows the base circle of the involute, and the slider controls the radius of the gear:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_radius_shape"></div>
<div id="gears_radius_shape_slider_container"></div>
<p>Two matching involute gears with different number of teeth, and thus different radii, will have slightly <em>different</em> shapes of teeth. In the limit, when the radius of a gear is infinite, the involute becomes a straight line. A segment of a gear with infinite radius is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_and_pinion">rack</a>. That linear gear is commonly found in a steering mechanism of a car.</p>
<p>The involute has another practical property – it maintains the constant transmission ratio even when pitch circles of the two gears aren&rsquo;t in perfect positions. This allows for some inaccuracies in the placement of the two shafts driving the gears.</p>
<p>Thanks to many useful properties the involute is the most commonly used tooth profile, however, some applications make use of non-involute gears. For example, <a href="https://www.tec-science.com/mechanical-power-transmission/cycloidal-gear/meshing-of-cycloidal-gears/">cycloidal</a> gears are used in clocks and watches.</p>
<h1 id="multiple-gears">Multiple Gears<a href="index.html#multiple-gears" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"><img src="../images/anchor.png" width="16px" height="8px"/></a> </h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what happens when we add a third gear to the system:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_three"></div>
<div id="gears_three_slider_container"></div>
<p>Firstly, notice that introduction of the third gear has reversed the direction of the output shaft – it now rotates in the same direction as the first. Let&rsquo;s calculate how the second blue gear has affected the angular velocity of the third green gear. We can express the final angular velocity of the third gear as:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">&omega;<sub>3</sub></span> = <span>&omega;<sub>2</sub></span> &middot; <span class="gear_frac"><span>N<sub>2</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">N<sub>3</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<p>We also know that the angular velocity of the second gear depends on the first one:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">&omega;<sub>2</sub></span> = <span>&omega;<sub>1</sub></span> &middot; <span class="gear_frac"><span>N<sub>1</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">N<sub>2</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<p>The substitution yields:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">&omega;<sub>3</sub></span> = <span>&omega;<sub>1</sub></span> &middot; <span class="gear_frac"><span>N<sub>2</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">N<sub>3</sub></span>
</span> &middot; <span class="gear_frac"><span>N<sub>1</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">N<sub>2</sub></span>
</span> = <span>&omega;<sub>1</sub></span> &middot; <span class="gear_frac"><span>N<sub>1</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">N<sub>3</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<p>When three gears are connected like that the number of teeth of the middle, so-called <em>idler</em> gear, doesn&rsquo;t matter for the angular velocity and torque of the output.</p>
<p>We can create a multi gear system in another way. In the demonstration below the red and blue gears are fixed together and they both rotate with their shaft at the same angular velocity:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_four"></div>
<div id="gears_four_slider_container"></div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s peek at the equations of the pairs of meshing gears. The fourth green gear is driven by the third red gear:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">&omega;<sub>4</sub></span> = <span>&omega;<sub>3</sub></span> &middot; <span class="gear_frac"><span>N<sub>3</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">N<sub>4</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<p>And the second blue gear is driven by the first yellow gear:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">&omega;<sub>2</sub></span> = <span>&omega;<sub>1</sub></span> &middot; <span class="gear_frac"><span>N<sub>1</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">N<sub>2</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<p>In this case, however, angular velocities of the third and second gear are the same:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
&omega;<sub>3</sub> = &omega;<sub>2</sub>
</div>
<p>And we end up with:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">&omega;<sub>4</sub></span> = <span>&omega;<sub>1</sub></span> &middot; <span class="gear_frac"><span>N<sub>1</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">N<sub>2</sub></span>
</span> &middot; <span class="gear_frac"><span>N<sub>3</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">N<sub>4</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<p>Similar logic applies for equations of torque transfer:</p>
<div class="gear_equation">
<span class="gear_frac_lhs">T<sub>4</sub></span> = <span>T<sub>1</sub></span> &middot; <span class="gear_frac"><span>N<sub>2</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">N<sub>1</sub></span>
</span> &middot; <span class="gear_frac"><span>N<sub>4</sub></span>
    <span class="gear_div_symbol">/</span>
    <span class="gear_div_bottom">N<sub>3</sub></span>
</span>
</div>
<p>In this configuration all four gears participate in the final ratio of adjustment. A multi stage transmission enables a significant reduction in size of the assembly – a single stage setup with 4:1 reduction like in the example above would have to be both wider <em>and</em> much taller. Additionally, with multiple stages a machine can change the gearing ratios relatively easily like it happens in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCu9W9xNwtI">manual transmission gearbox</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you never plan to design a functional set of gears, it may be worth knowing how <em>not</em> to design one. In the demonstration below you can see what happens when the three gears are meshing with each other – the mechanism gets jammed:</p>
<div class="drawer_container" id="gears_jam"></div>
<div class="segmented_container" id="gears_jam_segmented_container"></div>
<p>By moving the blue gear slightly to the left we can see that the yellow gear wants to rotate it clockwise, however, by placing the blue gear to the right we can see that the green gear wants to rotate it counterclockwise.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the &ldquo;three jammed gears&rdquo; pitfall is <a href="https://www.lockhaven.edu/~dsimanek/whoops.htm#gears">quite common</a> in graphics design. However, if you try really hard and have an access to a 3D printer, you may actually be able to pull off at least <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Mf0JpTI_gg"><em>some</em> version</a> of it.</p>

<p>The considerations behind real world gears are much more complicated than what I&rsquo;ve presented. The physical world is messy – the gears aren&rsquo;t perfectly rigid, they thermally expand during operation, and their surfaces wear over time. All of these factors have to be accounted for in the domain of engineering.</p>
<p>Despite all that, under the murky waters of physical reality, the idealized mathematical principles of gears are still there. I&rsquo;ve hopefully shown you that gears aren&rsquo;t just some discs with teeth – there is a lot of mathematical ingenuity in their design.</p>
